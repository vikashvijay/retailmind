# RetailMind — AI Business Partner

> A fully LLM-powered retail intelligence platform. No rule-based logic. Every insight, decision, and copilot answer is generated by Groq's LLaMA model from your live data.

## Architecture

```
Flask REST API
├── app.py                    ← API server + session management
├── models/demand_model.py    ← ML demand forecasting (GB + RF ensemble / TF MLP)
└── utils/ai_engine.py        ← Groq LLM engine (decisions, insights, copilot)

Frontend (HTML + CSS + JS)
├── templates/index.html      ← Single-page application
├── static/css/main.css       ← Aurora glassmorphism dark UI
└── static/js/main.js         ← All interactions + Chart.js
```

## AI Features (all LLM-powered)

| Smart Actions | LLaMA analyzes every product and generates specific action cards (Restock, Clear, Promote, Bundle, etc.) with reasoning, impact prediction, urgency scores |
| Business Insights | Full business health report: risks, opportunities, category analysis, prioritized action plan |
| Ask Anything | RAG-style copilot — sends your live data as context, returns conversational answers with data cards and tables |
